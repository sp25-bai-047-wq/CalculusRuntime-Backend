"""Quiz scores routes.

Certification-quiz flow (`/start` + `/submit`) is server-authoritative:
questions are shuffled per attempt, correct answers never leave the
server, and grading happens here — not in the browser. See quiz_bank.py
for the question bank.

Every graded attempt is recorded twice:
  - quiz_scores  → best score per (user, quiz), used for certificate
                   eligibility checks in routers/certificates.py.
  - quiz_attempts → full history, never overwritten (powers the
                    "attempt history" view).
